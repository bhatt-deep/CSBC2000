# Assignment 3

In this assignment you will take the concepts you've learned in this class and compile them into a blockchain solution. You will start by coming up with a problem statement which can either be unique or an existing blockchain solution. Then, you will identify the need for using the blockchain using a lean blockchain canvas that you can [find on Moodle](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1K-wnl0E4viu2OjjlM_02oCWggBpsNHplG_uiPWKHT7g/copy).
You have to develop a blockchain-based solution for your problem using all the concepts you have learned in this class. This solution must clearly state:
- Whether you are using a private/public/consortium blockchain and why
- What the end-to-end architecture of your blockchain is (where nodes are stored, what transaction information looks like, how blocks are created, etc.). You can use a service like [diagrams](https://app.diagrams.net/) to create a visual representation
- If it is a type 1, type 2 or type 3 blockchain solution
- What your smart contract functions will be
- How the blockchain will add security/resilience to the transaction data that's on it

## Submission
Submission will require a 2-3 minute video that explains the problem and the solution with the components described above in addition to the filled-out blockchain lean canvas. The video can be uploaded as an unlisted video on Youtube or uploaded to Moodle in an acceptable video format (.mp4, .avi)

## Help
This is a more unstructured assignment than the past ones so please make sure you address any incertitude as early as possible. You can post questions on the discussion forum, ask me at the beginning/end of class or email me for this.
